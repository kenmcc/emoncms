A bunch of RFM12B based nodes scattered around the house giving real-time data on temperature and weather.

One of them can turn on and off the electric radiator in my baby daughters room using RF433 

Python Script runs on Raspberry Pi and gets the data from the nodes, also using an RFM12b and interprets them
